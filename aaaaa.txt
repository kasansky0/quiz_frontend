Arc Flash Hazard:
A dangerous condition associated with the possible release of energy caused by an electric arc.

Incident Energy:
The amount of thermal energy released during an arc flash, measured at a certain distance, typically in cal/cm².

Second degree burn:
Possible by exposure of unprotected skin to an arc flash above 1.2 cal/cm²; therefore, all exposed skin must be protected at levels greater than 1.2 cal/cm².

A downstream 30A fuse will always blow before an upstream 100A fuse.
Answer: False

A primary cell is one in which the chemical action is irreversible.
Answer: TRUE
Additional info: Primary batteries include alkaline, heavy-duty, and general-purpose batteries; they deliver their rated capacity once and are not designed to be recharged.
